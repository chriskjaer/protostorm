Simple Guard setup for small client-side test sites or projects.

### Usage:
- Git Clone Protostorm to your folder.
- Run "bundle install" and let it install the nessesary gems.
- Run "powder link" your project folder is now linked to "projectname".dev
- Run "bundle exec guard" Guard will watch for changes and compile everytime something happens.
- ???
- Profit.

On next run. Just run bundle exec guard.

### When is this usefull?
This is my personal setup and I like HAML, SASS (What's not to love?) and my CSS SMACSS'ed and I couldn't live without the awesome Compass Mixins.
So this simple setup makes my life easier when I have to write simple clickable wireframes or write a small CSS module.
